The Fulton County Grand Jury is a crucial component of the judicial system in Fulton County, Georgia. It plays a significant role in the criminal justice process, particularly in determining whether there is sufficient evidence to indict individuals accused of committing crimes. This essay will explore the structure, functions, and recent activities of the Fulton County Grand Jury, providing a comprehensive overview of its importance and impact on the community.

The Fulton County Grand Jury is composed of a group of citizens who are selected to serve as jurors. These individuals are responsible for reviewing evidence presented by the prosecution and determining whether there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that the accused person is responsible for that crime. The grand jury operates under the supervision of the Fulton County District Attorney's Office, which presents evidence and witnesses to the jury for consideration.

One of the primary functions of the Fulton County Grand Jury is to issue indictments. An indictment is a formal accusation that a person has committed a crime. The grand jury reviews the evidence presented by the prosecution and hears testimony from witnesses. If the jury finds that there is sufficient evidence to support the charges, it will return an indictment, also known as a "true bill." If the jury does not find sufficient evidence, it will return a "no bill," and the accused person will not be charged with the crime.

The Fulton County Grand Jury has been active in issuing indictments for various crimes in the county. For example, on February 10, 2025, the grand jury handed down nine indictments for crimes including possession of cocaine, domestic violence, strangulation, and forgery. The indictments were announced by the Fulton County Prosecuting Attorney's Office and included charges against individuals from various locations, including Fayette, Swanton, Wauseon, and Detroit.

In another instance, on March 17, 2025, the Fulton County Grand Jury considered indictments charging individuals with Fulton County crimes, according to the Fulton County Prosecuting Attorney's Office.

These examples demonstrate the grand jury's role in holding individuals accountable for their actions and ensuring that justice is served in the community.

The Fulton County Grand Jury also plays a role in investigating alleged election interference in the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. The special purpose grand jury was convened to examine allegations of election interference committed by former President Donald Trump and others. The grand jury's final report, released on September 8, detailed the findings of the investigation and provided recommendations for further action.

The Fulton County Grand Jury's activities are supported by various departments and offices within the county. The Fulton County District Attorney's Office, Trial Division, is responsible for presenting evidence and witnesses to the grand jury for consideration. The Office of the Jury Clerk manages juror service for the Superior, State, and Probate Courts in Fulton County. The Fulton County Sheriff's Office also plays a role in supporting the grand jury's activities, particularly in the area of inmate management and jail programs.

In addition to its role in issuing indictments, the Fulton County Grand Jury also has the authority to investigate other matters of public concern. For example, the grand jury can investigate allegations of public corruption, misconduct by public officials, and other issues that affect the community. The grand jury's investigative powers allow it to subpoena witnesses, compel testimony, and review documents and other evidence related to the investigation.
